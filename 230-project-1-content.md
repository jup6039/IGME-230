## Story
While walking around the area outside her hometown, a young wizard named Zana suddenly finds herself lost in the Forest of Lost Souls. She has heard many tales about ghosts wandering through the forest trying to find the afterlife. The ghosts attack any living beings who dare enter the forest, hoping to take over their bodies and come back to life. Zana must find her way out of the forest while fighting off the ghosts so that they do not steal her body. She can also collect the soul fragments that defeated ghosts drop and use them for future magic research.

The game is not meant to be scary or difficult. It is a simple, casual game about fighting ghosts and collecting soul fragments within the given time limit.
## Esthetics
Cartoonish graphic style with some simple spooky Halloween-esque music for the background music and sound effects for when the player shoots a magic orb, defeats a ghost, or picks up a soul fragment
## Gameplay
The player uses the WASD keys to move and the mouse to aim and shoot orbs by clicking. Time will count down on the top right of the screen, and the player must survive for the entire time in order to win. The amount of soul fragments collected will be kept track of in top right as well. The player has three lives. In order to survive, the player must not drop to zero lives. The player loses one life when touched by a ghost, which will disappear upon contact. Extra lives will not be given. The player can choose to dodge the ghosts as after some time they will travel off-screen. The player can also shoot the ghosts by moving the mouse in the direction they would like to shoot and clicking the left mouse button to shoot. If the player shoots a ghost, the ghost will disappear and leave behind a soul fragment. The player can then pick up the soul fragment and increase their score. If the player does not pick up the fragment, it will disappear after some time.

The player wins by surviving until the timer reaches zero. They do not need to shoot the ghosts or collect the fragments, but shooting the ghosts will make surviving easier. The more ghosts defeated, the less there are to dodge. The game will become increasingly difficult as the timer gets closer to zero by spawning more and more ghosts. The player can try to win the game without defeating ghosts, but this will be very difficult. The easiest way to win is to shoot the ghosts.
